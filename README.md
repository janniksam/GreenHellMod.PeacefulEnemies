# GreenHellMod.PeacefulEnemies

Whenever you're in range of an enemy, where it would normally start to attack you, with this mod activated it will stay in a "prepare to attack" state and never actually attack you.

This way you will be able to take a closer look at each of the dangerous animals in the game.
